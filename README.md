About XeFramework
=================

Hi, This is modified version of starter theme called `_s`, or `underscores`, if you like. It's meant for hacking so don't use it as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning it into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what this framework is here for.

Getting Started With Theme
--------------------------

Download `_xe` from GitHub. The first thing you want to do is copy the `_xe` directory and change the name to something else (like, say, `megatherium`), and then you'll need to do a seven-step find and replace on the name in all the templates.

1. Search for `'_xe'` (inside single quotations) to capture the text domain.
2. Search for `_xe_` to capture all the function names.
3. Search for `Text Domain: _xe` in style.css.
4. Search for <code>&nbsp;_xe</code> (with a space before it) to capture DocBlocks.
5. Search for `_xe-` to capture prefixed handles.
6. Search for `xe_opt` to capture global variables.
7. Search for `Xe_` to capture prefixed classes.

OR

1. Search for: `'_xe'` and replace with: `'megatherium'`
2. Search for: `_xe_` and replace with: `megatherium_`
3. Search for: `Text Domain: _xe` and replace with: `Text Domain: megatherium` in style.css.
4. Search for: <code>&nbsp;_xe</code> and replace with: <code>&nbsp;Megatherium</code>
5. Search for: `_xe-` and replace with: `megatherium-`
6. Search for: `xe_opt` and replace with: `megatherium_opt`
7. Search for: `Xe_` and replace with: `Megatherium_`

Then, update the stylesheet header in `style.css` Next, delete this readme.
